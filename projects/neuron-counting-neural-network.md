title: "Neuron Counting Neural Network"
---

This project focuses on creating a neural network specifically designed for counting stained neurons in microscope images. Neuroscience research commonly involves the process of staining, imaging, and manually counting cells. The process of manually counting cells can be incredibly tedious and time consuming, therefore we attempted to create a neural network to count dopaminergic neurons for researchers. I completed this project with two other students during my study abroad program in Copenhagen in our neural networks class. We delved into the development and application of neural networks for efficient and accurate neuron counting, and explored the many strengths and limitations of different neural network models.
