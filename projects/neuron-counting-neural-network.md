 Neuroscience research commonly involves the process of staining, imaging, and manually counting cells. The process of manually counting cells can be incredibly tedious and time consuming, therefore we attempted to create a neural network to count dopaminergic neurons for researchers. I completed this project with two other students during my study abroad program in Copenhagen in our neural networks class. We delved into the development and application of neural networks, and explored the many strengths and limitations of different neural network models. This was my first ever neural network project and it was completed over the course of a few weeks. In hindsight I would change a lot about our approach (such as using a model for image segmentation) but it was a fun first project that felt very practical.
