Hello!

This is my first post on this website, and I'm thrilled to have you here. I'm currently a developer/implementation consultant for the Oklahoma Tax commission. However, I majored in neurosciece and computer science, and would like to attend a graduate degree program to further my study in the field.

On this website, I will share my previous projects and upcoming work on topics such as neural networks visualizations and natural language processing. I will also post about the stops on my journey with resources and tips that I find useful for learning and exploring this fascinating field. 

I will try to make monthly updates and back post older work that I have done before. I hope you will find my website informative, engaging, and useful. If you are reading this and want to reach out about any of my work, feel free to email me. Thank you for visiting my website and stay tuned for more!
