**Books Read: 8, Average Rating: 3.9 Stars**

**Burn by Peter Heller:**  2/5 Stars. This book felt like it was trying to be edgy hard to dramatize politics without following through on some of it's most compelling ideas around a US state succession.

**Ratings & One-Sentence Reviews:**

**The Message (Ta‐Nehisi Coates) – ★★★** Though it tackles critical issues on race and history, the book ultimately lacks the nuanced depth needed to explore its complexities."

**Before the Coffee Gets Cold (Toshikazu Kawaguchi) – ★★★★** This is a re-read but it is a warm exploration of second chances that makes time travel feel welcoming.

**The Underground Railroad (Colson Whitehead) – ★★★★★** This is a poignant, harrowing, and masterfully written story of escape from slavery; they should teach this in schools.

**Revenge of the Tipping Point (Malcolm Gladwell) – ★★★★** I loved the tippinhg point so I knew I would enjoy this, it lives up to the hype.

**The Backyard Bird Chronicles (Amy Tan) – ★★★**  Cozy and endearing at its best, it feels simply written and wanders without clear direction.

**The Wager (David Grann) – ★★★★★**  This novel is a gripping, impeccably researched maritime epic that tells a true story I previously knew nothing about.

**Hillbilly Elegy (J.D. Vance) – ★★★** Though occasionally polarizing, it offers insights into Appalachian struggles and context for J.D. Vance’s vice presidency.

**Someone Like Us (Dinaw Mengestu) – ★★★★** I loved this powerful tale of identity and the subtle threads of connection that bind us together

**The Dutch House (Ann Patchett) – ★★★★** This book is a richly layered family tale centered on a mysterious house, which does a great job exploring themes of how memory can shape .

**General Thoughts**
This month has been extremely busy. For my New Year’s resolutions, I decided to focus on developing one new positive habit—or eliminating one negative habit—each month. While I don’t expect to succeed with every single change, my hope is to finish the year healthier and more organized overall.

My first habit goal for January was to avoid picking up my phone and doomscrolling first thing in the morning. This proved challenging, and I didn’t manage to stick to it perfectly every day. However, I did significantly reduce my morning screen time by using two strategies. First, I installed an app that disables all non-essential apps on my phone for the first hour of the day. Second, I bought a small notebook and, before bed, I write down a morning to-do list for the following day. I place the list over my phone to remind me not to use it until I’ve checked off all the items. This approach worked very well, and I believe it will help me incorporate other morning habits as the year progresses. While I haven’t been perfect—there were definitely mornings when I reverted to old habits—overall, these two methods significantly cut down my morning screen time. I feel more focused and less anxious, which has been a big win.

The month wasn’t without its challenges. With final projects aJanuary was also the height of final projects and exams. Between writing papers, studying, and working on group assignments, I spent most of my free time glued to my computer or textbooks. This academic crunch made it harder to be social or engage in other hobbies, but I’m grateful that I was able to channel my energy into staying productive.

Unfortunately, a foot injury this month limited my mobility and kept me on crutches. Although it was frustrating not to be able to move around freely, it also meant I wasn’t missing out on too many social events—I couldn’t have attended them comfortably even if I wanted to. The injury forced me to slow down and focus on healing, which, in a strange way, dovetailed with my desire to spend less time on my phone and more time on focused tasks. Hopefully, I’ll be back on my feet soon.nd exams, I devoted most of my time to schoolwork. Complicating matters, I injured my foot and spent much of the month on crutches, so I wasn’t able to go out and about even if I had the time.

Despite the stress of final exams and my foot injury, I did manage to have some encouraging breakthroughs in my research. After weeks of reading, discussing with peers, and testing out different approaches, I feel the experimental protocol is almost finalized. This is a significant milestone because it paves the way for the next stage: building the models and conducting the actual experiments. I’m excited to see what results we can generate and how this work might contribute to the field.

Between academic deadlines, a foot injury, and the usual pressures of daily life, I’ve come to appreciate that small, consistent efforts can lead to meaningful changes. As I look toward next month, I’m optimistic about building on this momentum—whether that means perfecting my morning routine, incorporating a new healthy habit, or staying focused on my research objectives. Each step, however small, brings me closer to my goal of ending the year with better health, stronger organization skills, and a more positive mindset.
