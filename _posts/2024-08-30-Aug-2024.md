**General Thoughts**
August was not particularly eventful, but pleasantly so as I was able to get into a routine now that I am back in NYC until October. I've started to prepare for my masters degree program by doing some linear algebra review. I started doing remote research for Professor Sarit Kraus at BIU. I am incredibly excited to work with her; I find her research in AI and multi agent systems fascinating. To begin I have mostly been reading research papers to get a better lay of the land of her work and related work. I have also started writing a few research proposals for project ideas, but I need to make sure I come up with something that seems doable within the one year I am at BIU. 

**Reset Questions**

**What went well in August?**
- I got into a routine and was able to rest after July's travel
- I started doing research with Professor Kraus!!!
- I Joined a DnD group with a friend from college

**What didn't go so well in August and what can I improve?**
- I can tell I am beginning to overschedule myself and I need to make sure I don't do that too early in grad school
- I haven't been that organized with keeping track of the research papers I am reading and I want to be more structured about it

**Goals for September?**
- Continue working on my research project
- Begin preparing to move to Israel
- Set up calling schedules with friends in advance of moving
