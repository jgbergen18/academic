**General Thoughts**

**Reset Questions**

**What went well in August?**


**What didn't go so well in August and what can I improve?**
I let the stress from my last month of work get to me and was too focused on perfectionism to leave work on a good note. This somewhat got in the way of how much I was able to enjoy this last full month in OKC before I move, so I want to make sure I hit my bucket list items.

**Goals for September?**
- knock off last few Oklahoma bucket list items before moving
- practice driving on the road trip
- start curriculum prep for volunteering in Ukraine
