Hello! My name is Jamie Bergen. I started this website on January 24th 2024, and it is currently a work in progress I recently graduated from Barnard College and am currently working for the Oklahoma Tax Commission. My primary interests are in computational biology, data science, and artifical inteligence, I hope to attend graduate school to conduct cutting edge research in this field.
