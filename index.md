My name is Jamie Bergen and I am a passionate learner and explorer of the intersection between biology, data, and intelligence. I created this website on January 24th, 2024, to share my prevous work, projects, and reflections  Please bear with me as I add more content and features to this site.

A little bit about me: I graduated from Barnard College in May 2023 and double majored in neuroscience and behavior and computer science. During my undergraduate studies, I was involved in several research projects on the interestions between the immune system, genetics, and neurological disorders. I am most proud of the research I conducted for my senior thesis that contributed to the publication of the paper: Interaction of an a-synuclein epitope with HLA-DRB1*15:01 recapitulates enteric features associated with prodromal Parkinsonâ€™s disease in mice. 

I am working as a software developer and consultant for the Oklahoma Tax Commission, where I help optimize tax collection and compliance particularly in the area of tax fraud. I enjoy getting to work with large and complex datasets and contributing to work that affects millions of taxpayers.

I am particularly interested in neuromorphic computing. Especially regarding how we can use information about biologically inspired neural networks to better understand the organization of the brain and how we make decisions. Ultimately I hope to pursue a Ph.D in Computational Neuroscience or a related field to conduct research of this kind.

I hope you find something interesting and useful on my website. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions. Thank you!
