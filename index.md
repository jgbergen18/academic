My name is Jamie Bergen and I am passionate about the intersections between biology, data, and intelligence. I created this website on January 24th, 2024, to share my previous work, projects, and reflections. Please bear with me as I add more content and features to this site.

A little bit about me: I graduated from Barnard College of Columbia Univeristy in May 2023 and majored in neuroscience and computer science (with a concentration in intelligent systems). During my undergraduate studies, I was involved in several research projects on the intersections between the immune system, genetics, and neurological disorders. I am most proud of the research I conducted for my senior thesis which contributed to the publication of the paper: Interaction of an a-synuclein epitope with HLA-DRB1*15:01 recapitulates enteric features associated with prodromal Parkinsonâ€™s disease in mice in the journal Neuron. 

My primary fields of interest are in machine intelligence, data science, as well as neuromorphic computing. These interests highlight an underlying passion to better understand the nature of intelligence, machine or otherwise. I believe all of these fields will help to better understand how we make decisions, the mechanics of cognition and even the organization of the brain.

In October I will be embarking on a journey to attain a masters degree in brain and data science through the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Scholarship. My first year of the program will be spent in Ramat Gan, Israel, and the Second year will be spent in Lisbon, Portugal. I feel incredibly excited and fortunate to have been awarded this opportunity and I will post updates as the program progresses.

I hope you find something interesting and useful on my website. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions. Thank you!
