My name is Jamie Bergen and I am passionate about the intersections between biology, data, and intelligence. I graduated from Barnard College of Columbia Univeristy in May 2023 and majored in neuroscience and computer science (with a concentration in intelligent systems).

My primary fields of interest are in machine intelligence, data science, and neuromorphic computing. These interests highlight an underlying passion to better understand the nature of intelligence, machine or otherwise. I believe all of these fields will help to better understand how we make decisions, the mechanics of cognition and even the organization of the brain.

I have recently started a masters degree in brain and data science through the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Scholarship. My first year of the program will be spent in Ramat Gan, Israel, and the second year will be spent in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I feel incredibly excited and fortunate to have been awarded this opportunity and I will post updates as the program progresses.

I hope you find something interesting and useful on my website. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions. Thank you!
