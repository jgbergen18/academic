My name is Jamie Bergen and I am passionate about the intersections between biology, data, and intelligence. I created this website on January 24th, 2024, to share my previous work, projects, and reflections. Please bear with me as I add more content and features to this site.

A little bit about me: I graduated from Barnard College in May 2023 and double majored in neuroscience and behavior and computer science. During my undergraduate studies, I was involved in several research projects on the intersections between the immune system, genetics, and neurological disorders. I am most proud of the research I conducted for my senior thesis that contributed to the publication of the paper: Interaction of an a-synuclein epitope with HLA-DRB1*15:01 recapitulates enteric features associated with prodromal Parkinsonâ€™s disease in mice. 

I have also worked in tech as a software developer and consultant for the Oklahoma Tax Commission, where I helped optimize tax collection and compliance particularly in the area of tax fraud. I enjoyed getting to work with large and complex datasets and contributing to work that affects millions of taxpayers.

My two primary fields of interest are in neuro/computational linguistics, as well as neuromorphic computing. Especially regarding how we can use information about biologically inspired neural networks to better understand the organization of the brain, how we make decisions, and even how we learn languages. Ultimately I hope to pursue a Ph.D in Computational Neuroscience or a related field to conduct research of this kind.

In october I will be embarking on a journey to attain a masters degree in brain and data science through the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Scholarship. I feel incredibly excited and fortunate to have been awarded this opportunity and I will post updates ad the program progresses.

I hope you find something interesting and useful on my website. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions. Thank you!
