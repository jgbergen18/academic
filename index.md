My name is Jamie Bergen and I am passionate about the intersections between biology, data, and intelligence. I created this website on January 24th, 2024, to share my previous work, projects, and reflections. Please bear with me as I add more content and features to this site.

A little bit about me: I graduated from Barnard College of Columbia Univeristy in May 2023 and double majored in neuroscience and computer science (with a concentration in intelligent systems). During my undergraduate studies, I was involved in several research projects on the intersections between the immune system, genetics, and neurological disorders. I am most proud of the research I conducted for my senior thesis that contributed to the publication of the paper: Interaction of an a-synuclein epitope with HLA-DRB1*15:01 recapitulates enteric features associated with prodromal Parkinsonâ€™s disease in mice. 

I have spent the last year working in tech as a software developer for the Oklahoma Tax Commission, where I helped optimize tax collection and compliance particularly in the area of tax fraud. I enjoyed getting to work with large and complex datasets and contributing to work that affects millions of taxpayers.

My primary fields of interest are in machine intelligence, neuro/computational linguistics, as well as neuromorphic computing. These interests highlight an underlying passion to better understand the nature of intelligence, machine or otherwise. I believe all of these fields will help to better understand how we make decisions, the mechanics of cognition and even the organization of the brain. Ultimately I hope to pursue a Ph.D in Computational Neuroscience or a related field to conduct research of this kind.

In October I will be embarking on a journey to attain a masters degree in brain and data science through the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Scholarship. I feel incredibly excited and fortunate to have been awarded this opportunity and I will post updates as the program progresses.

I hope you find something interesting and useful on my website. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions. Thank you!
